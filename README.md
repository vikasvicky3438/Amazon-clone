Amazon home page using HTML and CSS

ABOUT US

We are Priyanshu Shekhar and Vikas, first-year IT students at IIIT Allahabad. As beginners in the field of web development, we wanted to take on a project that would help us improve our skills and understanding of how websites are built. Together, we created a simple clone of Amazon using only HTML and CSS. This project focuses on replicating the design and layout of Amazon's website. It helped us learn how to structure web pages and style them to look professional. While the clone doesn’t include advanced features like JavaScript or backend functionality, it reflects our hard work and commitment to learning the basics of web development. We are excited to continue building our skills and working on more complex projects in the future.
WORK DONE BY US
In this project, we, Priyanshu Shekhar and Vikas, worked together to create a basic clone of the Amazon website as part of our journey to learn the foundations of web development. As first-year IT students at IIIT Allahabad, we wanted to focus on understanding and practicing the fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS, which are essential for creating websites. The project aimed to replicate the design and layout of Amazon’s website, which gave us an excellent opportunity to explore how professional websites are structured and styled.  
We started by breaking down the website into different sections, such as the header, navigation bar, product listings, and footer, and carefully recreated them using only HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling. In the header, we included placeholders for the logo, search bar, and cart icon to give it a look similar to Amazon. The navigation bar was designed to organize the categories and links, while the product section showcased sample items in a grid layout. The footer was styled to display links and additional details, maintaining the overall appearance of a professional e-commerce website.  
Throughout the process, we focused on writing clean and well-organized code, ensuring that the layout was responsive and visually appealing. We experimented with various CSS properties like flexbox, grid, margins, paddings, and colors to make the design as close as possible to the original. This project was an excellent learning experience for both of us, as it taught us how to approach a real-world design challenge, break it into smaller tasks, and solve problems along the way.  
Although this clone is not fully functional and doesn’t include advanced features like JavaScript interactivity, user authentication, or a backend for managing data, it represents an important step in our journey as web developers. This project gave us hands-on experience and helped us understand the importance of attention to detail, consistency in design, and proper use of HTML and CSS. We are proud of what we’ve created and look forward to continuing to improve our skills by taking on more challenging projects in the future.
